## What is this?

Each folder is a separate [PowerShell][4] script that is in some way applicable to running on devices or via the API using the [NinjaOne][5] platform. Most scripts are documented through comments at the top and often require some level of configuration or parameters to use fully. Please understand the code you run, I make no claim or warranty or fitness for any particular purpose!

Scripts that are intended to be run on Windows endpoints are generally written for PowerShell 5.1, while scripts that access the API are written primarily for [PowerShell 7][6] and are mostly untested on earlier versions. API scripts will make use of the [NinjaOne PowerShell module][7].
